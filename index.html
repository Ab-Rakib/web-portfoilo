          In the Quran, Allah (swt) says: “Help one another in acts of piety and
          righteousness. And do not assist each other in acts of sinfulness and
          transgression. And be aware of Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in
          punishment” (Quran 5:2).

          Private detectives and investigators’ main purpose is to help others
          gather information and analyze it to uncover unsolved mysteries. They
          work on cases for businesses, attorneys and individuals and are
          sometimes asked to be bodyguards for celebrities, executives, and
          corporate people. Private detectives and investigators specialize in
          the following areas: background checks, computer forensics, locate
          missing people, child support investigations, spousal surveillance,
          employee investigations, email tracing, and asset searches.

          2019 - | Some Experience About Detective
        </h3>
        <p>
          Private detectives and investigators are trained to use high-tech
          surveillance equipment for cases requiring surveillance of a home or
          other places. They have to obey the law when conducting
          investigations, and understand the Federal and State legal issues that
          may affect their work. They must be intelligent, hard working, and
          dedicated to each individual case. Private detectives and
          investigators have to be able to work flexible hours, including early
          mornings, weekends, evenings, and some holidays.
